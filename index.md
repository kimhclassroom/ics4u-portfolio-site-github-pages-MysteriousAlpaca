# Hi, I'm <Dylan Wang>
This is my ICS4U portfolio repository, I will use it throughout the school year and potentially after as a collection of my work, reflections, and other assets. 

## Highlights
- 🔧 Project 1: *(title)* – *(1–2 lines about what it does)*
- 🧠 Concept I learned: *(short note)*
- 📝 Blog/Reflection: [Reflection #1](./posts/first_reflection.md)

## About me
My name is Dylan, I have beginner level coding experience but have strong experience with 3D assets. I am taking this course as an advanced introduction to potential software engineering majors in post-secondary education.
